        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti Bolognese is a much-loved family classic in the UK. Made with rich beef mince simmered 
            in a tomato-based sauce, it’s hearty, comforting, and full of flavour. Perfect for a weeknight 
            dinner or a Sunday family meal, this version strikes a balance between traditional Italian 
            inspiration and British home-cooking style.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook gently for 
                5 minutes until softened.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and carrot, cooking for a further 2–3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat slightly and add the beef mince. Cook until browned all over, breaking it 
                up with a wooden spoon as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato purée and cook for a minute before adding the chopped tomatoes, beef stock, 
                oregano, basil, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat. Simmer gently for 20–30 
                minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a large pan of salted boiling water according to the packet 
                instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Taste the Bolognese and adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the Bolognese over the cooked spaghetti, topped with grated Parmesan and a sprinkle of chopped 
                parsley if you like.</li>

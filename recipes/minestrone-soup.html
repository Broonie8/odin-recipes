            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>75g small pasta shapes or spaghetti (if you use spaghetti, suggest you break down into 
                smaller pieces)</li>
            <li>1 tin (400g) canellini or bolotti beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>A handful of kale or shredded cabbage (optional)</li>

            <li>Grated Parmesan or vegetarian hard cheese, to serve (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil or parsley, to garnish (optional) </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for about 
                5 minutes, until softened.</li>
            <li>Stir in the garlic, carrots, celery, courgette, and potato. Cook for a further 5–7 minutes, 
                stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato purée, vegetable stock, oregano, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring 
                to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15–20 minutes, or until the vegetables 
                are starting to soften.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta and beans to the pan. Simmer for a further 10–12 minutes, or until the pasta is 
                cooked. If using kale or cabbage, add it in the final 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaf, season with salt and pepper, and adjust the consistency with a splash of water 
                if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, topped with a sprinkle of Parmesan and fresh herbs if desired, and some crusty bread on 
                the side.</li>    
        </ol>
